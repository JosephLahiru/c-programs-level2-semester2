A call to wait() blocks the calling process until one of its child processes exits or a signal is received. After child process terminates, parent continues its execution after wait system call instruction.

The C library function void (*signal(int sig, void (*func)(int)))(int) sets a function to handle signal i.e. a signal handler with signal number sig.

– wait() : decrements the semaphore value. 

– signal() : increments the semaphore value.
